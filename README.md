# Project Title

Pig Game

## Introduction

This is a dice game (dice or pig game) project.

## Features

- Feature: A short, continuous, and exciting dice game that you can play with friends, family, or alone.

## Usage

There are two players, Player 1 and Player 2. Start the game by clicking the "Dice Roll" button. When you click it, the game will start for a player on either the left or right side, and one of the six sides of the dice will be counted as the score. You can increase your score by clicking this button multiple times, but be careful, if the side with the number 1 appears, the turn automatically goes to the other player, and your accumulated score resets to zero. So be cautious and click the "HOLD" button before the side with the number 1 appears to save your score. The same process applies to the other player. The exciting part begins now: whoever reaches 100 points first wins. But don't worry, you can start again by clicking "New Game." Good luck!
